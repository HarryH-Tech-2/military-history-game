    description: "Joan of Arc, a seventeen-year-old peasant girl claiming divine guidance, inspired the demoralized French army to break the English siege of Orl\u00e9ans in just nine days. Her arrival transformed French morale and led to a series of victories that turned the Hundred Years' War decisively in France's favor. The relief of Orl\u00e9ans paved the way for the coronation of Charles VII at Reims and began the process that would expel the English from France."

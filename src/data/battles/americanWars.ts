    description: "For 77 days beginning in January 1968, some 6,000 US Marines at the isolated Khe Sanh Combat Base were besieged by up to 40,000 North Vietnamese troops. Many Americans feared Khe Sanh would become a repeat of the French disaster at Dien Bien Phu. However, unlike the French, the Americans had overwhelming air support. Operation Niagara unleashed massive B-52 strikes that devastated the besieging forces. The siege coincided with the Tet Offensive and became a symbol of the war's grinding nature. The base was ultimately relieved and then controversially abandoned months later."

    description: "On January 30, 1968, during the Vietnamese lunar new year ceasefire, North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces launched coordinated attacks on over 100 cities and military installations across South Vietnam. Viet Cong sappers even breached the US Embassy compound in Saigon. The Battle of Hue raged for a month as Marines fought to recapture the ancient citadel. Though the offensive was a devastating military defeat for the communists, who suffered enormous casualties, it shattered American public confidence that the war was being won. The Tet Offensive proved to be a strategic turning point, leading to President Johnson's decision not to seek reelection and the beginning of American disengagement."

    description: "On September 15, 1950, General Douglas MacArthur launched a daring amphibious assault at Inchon, deep behind North Korean lines. The operation was considered nearly impossible due to extreme tidal variations, narrow approach channels, and high seawalls. Despite the risks, the landing achieved complete surprise. Within two weeks, the Marines had recaptured Seoul and cut the supply lines of the North Korean army besieging the Pusan Perimeter in the south. The North Korean invasion collapsed, and UN forces advanced rapidly northward, completely reversing the course of the war."

When told they were retreating, Marine commander General O.P. Smith famously declared, 'Retreat, hell! We're just attacking in a different direction.' Despite suffering heavy casualties from combat and frostbite, the Marines inflicted devastating losses on the Chinese and evacuated successfully by sea, preserving a battle-hardened force that would fight on."

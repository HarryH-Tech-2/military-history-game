    description: "The first major campaign fought entirely in the air saw the Royal Air Force defend Britain against the German Luftwaffe's attempt to gain air superiority as a precursor to invasion. Despite being heavily outnumbered, RAF Fighter Command's Spitfires and Hurricanes, aided by radar and brilliant tactics, inflicted unsustainable losses on the Luftwaffe. Churchill immortalized the RAF pilots with his famous tribute. Hitler indefinitely postponed Operation Sea Lion, his planned invasion of Britain."

Only 2,163 of 10,000 British airborne troops escaped, and the operation's failure dashed Allied hopes for ending the war in 1944."
